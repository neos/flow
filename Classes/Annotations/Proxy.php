    /**
     * Force the generation of serialization code (__sleep/__wakeup methods) in the proxy class.
     *
     * Flow automatically detects when serialization code is needed (e.g., when a class has entity
     * properties, injected dependencies, or transient properties) and generates the appropriate
     * __sleep() and __wakeup() methods. These methods handle:
     * - Converting entity references to metadata (class name + persistence identifier)
     * - Removing injected and framework-internal properties before serialization
     * - Restoring entity references and re-injecting dependencies after deserialization
     *
     * This flag serves as an **escape hatch for rare edge cases** where automatic detection fails,
     * such as:
     * - Complex generic/template types that aren't fully parsed (e.g., ComplexType<Entity>)
     * - Deeply nested entity structures where type hints don't reveal the entity relationship
     * - Union or intersection types with entities that the reflection system cannot fully analyze
     * - Properties with dynamic types where documentation hints are non-standard
     *
     * IMPORTANT: You should rarely need this flag. Flow's automatic detection handles:
     * - Properties typed with Flow\Entity classes
     * - Properties with Flow\Inject annotations
     * - Properties with Flow\Transient annotations
     * - Classes with AOP advices
     * - Session-scoped objects
     *
     * If you find yourself needing this flag for standard entity properties, injected dependencies,
     * or other common cases, this indicates a bug in Flow's detection logic that should be reported
     * at https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues
     *
     * Note: Disabling serialization code (not possible via this flag) would break classes with
     * AOP, injections, or entity relationships. To completely opt out of proxy features, use
     * enabled=false instead.
     *
     * @see https://flowframework.readthedocs.io/ for more information on object serialization
