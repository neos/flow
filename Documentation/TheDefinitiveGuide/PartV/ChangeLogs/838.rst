Overview of merged pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`BUGFIX: Dont log stack trace for `InvalidHashException` in Production <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3247>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This configures an ``invalidHashExceptions`` exception handler rendering group and configures it to not dump stack traces in ``Production`` context. For ``Development`` context stack traces are still written to ease debugging.

* See: `#3159 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3159>`_

**Upgrade instructions**

In case you need trace dumps for ``InvalidHashException`` in production context, override the settings as needed.

**Review instructions**

* See: `#3159 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3159>`_ for ways to trigger those exceptions. Then check if a trace is dumped.

`BUGFIX: Use configured cache factory <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3318>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previously used method to select the configured CacheFactory class from the Objects.yaml never returned a result as the raw configuration split by package name was accessed, therefore the fallback was used and it was not possible to provide a custom CacheFactory.

* Resolves: `#3317 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/3317>`_

`BUGFIX: Normalize source type for converting floats to ValueObjects <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3319>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change allows the ScalarTypeToObjectConverter to convert from floats to ValueObjects. The type converter uses ``gettype()`` which will return ``double`` for ``floats``. As the constructor argument type of the ValueObject is passed through ``TypeHandling::normalizeType()``, it will always be ``float`` and never ``double`` which will lead to floats not being converted by this type converter.

`BUGFIX: Web-Exception messages preserve whitespace (ASCII Art) <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/2697>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Closes `#2696 <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/issues/2696>`_

Exceptions which have multiple spaces in their $message where previously not as expected displayed.
Exceptions outputted to the CLI or logged did preserve multiple whitespaces naturally, but since they are collapsed in HTML by default, they are not shown in the browser.

Followup to https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/3116

I debugged with @dlubitz a problem and we found that in theory?  $output _might_ be possibly already filled?
I dont know if that can happen but just to be sure we set it to empty as its also a bad practice.

This change corrects the issue and needs to be upmerged accordingly.

The changes were never merged into the collection composer.json so that the issue was not noticed in development environments.
